# Build OpenVINOâ„¢ Runtime for Linux systems with XPU

## Software requirements

install and activate oneAPI env for XPU library and compiler

## How to build

1. Clone OpenVINO repository and init submodules:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino.git
   cd openvino
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```
   (Optional) For users in China, clone submodules via gitee mirrors
   ```sh
   chmod +x scripts/submodule_update_with_gitee.sh
   ./scripts/submodule_update_with_gitee.sh
   ```

2. Install build dependencies using the `install_build_dependencies.sh` script in the
   project root folder.
   ```sh
   sudo ./install_build_dependencies.sh
   ```

3. Activate DPC++ environment:
  ```sh
  source //intel/oneapi/setvars.sh
  ```

4. Create a build folder:
   ```sh
     mkdir build && cd build
   ```
5. OpenVINO Runtime uses a CMake-based build system. In the created `build` directory, run `cmake` to fetch project dependencies and create Unix makefiles, then run `make` to build the project:
   ```sh
     cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
     cmake --build . --parallel
   ```
   The process may take some time to finish. If you are using a system with limited resources, it is recommended to specify a lower number of parallel jobs to avoid overloading your system. This can help maintain system responsiveness and stability during the build process. Use `nproc` to find the number of available processing units. For example, to use 8 parallel jobs, run the following command:
      ```sh
      cmake --build . --parallel 8
      ```
